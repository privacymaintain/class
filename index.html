        <h2>5.Mt. Everest</h2>
        <p>Mount Everest [a] is the highest mountain on Earth. Mount Everest is in the Himalayas, a mountain range. It
            is about 8,848.00 metres (29,028.87 ft) high.[6]

            Its peak is on the border of Nepal and China, and lies in the Death zone where the air is too thin for a
            human being to live, so usually compressed gas tanks with different gas mixes for different altitudes are
            used when climbing. The Death Zone refers to the parts of Mount Everest that are above 7,600 metres (24,900
            ft) above sea level.</p>
